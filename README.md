# title_case / leap_year

This is a test exercise that is supposed to capitalize a title sentence, while link words such as articles ('a', 'an', 'the'), conjunctions ('and', 'but', 'or', ..) and prepositions ('at', 'on', 'in', ..) would remain in lowercase. Also, first and last words must be necessarily capitalized.

The same code was used to test BDD implementation for leap_year.
